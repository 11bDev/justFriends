## How It Works

When you open Facebook (facebook.com), the extension checks if you're on the main landing page. If so, it automatically redirects you to the friends feed using the `?sk=h_chr` parameter.

The extension only activates on Facebook pages and requires minimal permissions.

## Files

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `content.js` - Main redirect logic
- `icons/` - Extension icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
- `convert_icons.sh` - Script to generate PNG icons from SVG sources

## Customization

If you want to modify the behavior, edit `content.js`:

- Change the redirect URL by modifying `FRIENDS_FEED_PATH`
- Adjust which pages trigger the redirect in the conditional logic

## Troubleshooting

**Extension not working?**
- Make sure Developer Mode is enabled
- Check that the extension is enabled in your extensions list
- Try refreshing the Facebook page
- Check the browser console for any errors

**Want to disable temporarily?**
- Go to your browser's extensions page
- Toggle off the "Just Friends" extension
